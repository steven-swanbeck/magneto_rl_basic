- magneto_base is used for interfacing with the actual simulation, it is what is launched by running roslaunch magneto_rl base.launched
- magneto_env.py is the full gym environment with complete action and observation spaces
- magneto_plugin interfaces the dart simulation with the gym environment
- magneto_policy_learner should contain custom models and networks for learning
- magneto_utils houses some useful general purpose functions
- run_{}_magneto runs learning with the corresponding {}_magneto_env and {}_sim_plugin
- seed magnetism generates a magnetic contour of the surface
- test is just used for rapid prototyping


Next steps:
- If not with four legs, try to get learning with two distinct leg pairs?
- Integrate the magnetic uncertainty to both simple and full sims (maybe do this first?)
    - try to visualize the magnetic uncertainty as a background to the pygame window
    - how to make the robot deal with magnetic uncertainty in this way?
